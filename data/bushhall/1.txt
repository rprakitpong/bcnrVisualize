Chapter One

Robin woke one morning
Broke his fast with a worm
Tried flying on his commute
But he floundered and fell to the ground

Realised that his wings didn't work
Lying down on the ground
Saw the flowers were nice from below
Hedgehog came wandering to him

"You don't look right," Hedgehog said
Picking the dirt off his spines
"I know who will fix this for you
Go and find Mole"

He looked up, saw a boy
Offered the flowers to him
"Keep them for you, you've only got you"
He said, with a bang, he was gone
Who was the boy?
Who was the boy?
Who was the boy?

Chapter Two

Robin spent the morning
Hopping to find Mrs. Mole
Knew that she was struggling to find
The good that a mole could bring

"Who's this smiling boy
Crawling out of me?
Wish he'd be a good, kind mole
He might want to eat meat"

She looked straight into his eyes
Tears rolling into her ears
"Maybe I'm better just being a daughter"
Although she couldn't deny
Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy

Chapter Three

Mrs. Mole wiped her tears away
Looked at Robin's broken wings
"What do you expect a mole to fix?
Go and find Deer"

Robin dragged his body
Through the forest to the ground
Knew that that Deer lived a solitary life
Couldn't find a print on the ground

Robin sunk down to the earth, the mud pulled him gradually in
"Who am I to think that my selfish genes should keep going on?
Can I be the father
Like I dreamt about?"

Robin looked up, saw a hoof
Tried to get up to the ground
"Help me, Deer, please, help me, dear"
He reached his wings to the Deer

The Deer looked down, he liked to be alone
With a sigh, he gave him a lift
"I knew it was you, I'm glad it was you"
He knew from now he'd be alone
"I won't try to fly
I won't try to fly"

"I won't try to fly"
"I knew it was you, I hoped it was you"
From then, he knew he was alone
"I won't try to fly"
"I knew it was you, I hoped it was you"
From then, he knew he was alone

Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy
Wanting the boy

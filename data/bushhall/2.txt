I will always love you and
I will always want you
Even though we know the time's not right
I cry at night for you

I will always need you though
I know I've made it out, I don't
I'll hide the pain caused by your actions
Even when I said it's alright

I won't always love you and
I won't always want you
I needed you so I could learn more
Who knows what you needed me for

And I'm trying to be calm about it
But honestly I've never felt this way before
I can't live through another night like that
I can't live through another night like that
And you know it
And you know it

And I'm trying to be calm about it
But honestly I've never felt this way before
I can't live through another night like that
I can't live through another night like that
And you know it
And you know it
Oh, well

I won't always love you and
I won't always want you

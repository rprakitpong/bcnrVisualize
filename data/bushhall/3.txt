I took a trip away from life all by myself
Not my style but I was being someone else
The day arrived, a lonely walk as I find my seat upon the plane

Switch between some dull movies, I couldn't stare
As we shake, I close my eyes, I grip the chair
And while it lands my head expands and I think it's gonna split in two
False alarm, I knew

In my dream you came running to me
And then fall back into my arms
Wake up
Let's eat

Crowded trains, cement and cat's eyes after dark
Who'd have thought a square bagel's where it would start?
I needed this from someone kind but I never thought it would be you
You're my guide, my help, my hand into this town
And could you tell I really wanted you around?
And did you know how sweet you looked
When we sang that song at Winnie's place?
I was doin' it like May

In my dream you came running to me
And then fall back into my arms
Wake up
Let's eat

On our last night we watched a film and had a cry
How could I be ready to say goodbye?
And just like that you're in my mind
You're back into my arms again
My across the pond friend

In my dream you came running to me
And then fall back into my arms
Wake up
Let's eat

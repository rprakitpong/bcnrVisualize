Now I've seen you fall away from me
I walked tall, said we were meant to be
He's got meaning once again
At the ceiling in what was our room
A lot's gonna change on a rooftop, our tune
We made something to be proud of

And though you hurt
Feel like you've lost me
I turn around
I'll look back kindly
For we made something
Made something
Something to be proud of
To be proud

In a panic I put all your clothes in a cupboard
Trousers, T-shirts, and robes
It wasn't fair but I needed to
As you grew far away from us
I knew nothing of your feelings as such, but
We made something to be proud of

And though you hurt
Feel like you've lost me
I turn around
I'll look back kindly
For we made something
Made something
Something to

And though you hurt me
Feel like you've lost me
I turn around
I'll look back kindly
For we made something
Made something
Something to be proud of
To be proud of
The wrong trousers
To be proud of

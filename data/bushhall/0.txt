Look at what we did together
Don't know how you did it
Have you come out half the woman you were before?

Or twice the person you ever dreamt you could be?
Did you exchange your soul with the devil?

Oh, so that you could survive the dark
Pit in which you once lived
You once lived
You once lived

All these things will remain invisible to the world
And you wish you could be held
A silent embrace in the arms
Of another who knows what's wrong
They'll never know what we did together
No one will know

Look at what we did together
BC, NR friends forever
Look at what we did together
BC, NR friends forever
Look at what we did together
BC, NR friends forever
Look at what we did together

I've come apart
And I've fallen into two halves

I'll turn into a witch tonight
How did you happen to find me, sir?
Thought no one could see me now
I didn't put my clothes on

The bubble that you left then
I think it's safer than the cold
Not too late to go home now
I'll chew the pill for you

And I'm flying away but I think I saw
Some turbines turning beneath me

Don't waste your pearls on me
Don't waste your pearls on me
I'm only a pig, I'm only a pig
I'm only a pig, I'm only a pig

Slept beside the maggots and worms
Chewed through the mess that we made
Ploughed the ground good for you
Could grow some plants if you wanted to

Broke the zip inside my stomach
Blood dripping down onto the broom
Off the broom and through the sky
Mixed with your tears seeped to the ground

And I'm flying away but I think I saw
Some turbines turning beneath me

Don't waste your pearls on me
Don't waste your pearls on me
I'm only a pig, I'm only a pig
I'm only a pig, I'm only a pig
I'm only a pig, I'm only a pig
I'm only a pig

Without a broom or bubble
You learnt to fly all by yourself
You could see through the mess
You chose to float above us

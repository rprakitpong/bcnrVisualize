I remember when I used to laugh
Truthfully without wearing my mask
I wasn't ready to live like that
Had way more self destructive activities at hand
And now I've used them up
I'm all burnt out

There were many things that he saw
That no one else had seen in me before
Well, what, what does that say?
What does that say?
When you've accepted no one else
Will see you clear like that ever again

Tell me if I'm wrong in thinking this
But it's like every time we talk we start over again
What does that say?
What does that say?
When I'm left feeling like I lost so much
But maybe I just got it wrong

There's a few choices we have
But only one being good
But I, oh, I can't do it now
No, I can't do it now
Not now
So when?
Jesus Christ
Oh, when?

Because I let the best person I know
Walk away
Because I let the best person I know
Walk away
Oh, well, what does that say?
What does that say?

Laughing, I won't always love you
Trousers, turbines, up song, dancers
Laughing, I won't always love you
Trousers, turbines, up song, dancers
Laughing, I won't always love you
Trousers, turbines, up song

Laughing at your own songs again
How we laughed, you made me laugh
Well, what does that say?
What does that say?
When I've accepted no one else
Will make me laugh like that ever again

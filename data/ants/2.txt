Concorde, this organ
The new one I'm forming
It's grown so persistent on you
By the morning I'd fell to my feet
And the doctor said we are unfortunately
Running out of options to treat
What a funny way to speak

And you, like Concorde
I came, a gentle hill racer
I was breathless
Up on every mountain
Just to look for your light

Concorde, I miss you
Don't text me til winter
I can hardly afford
A second summer of Splinters
This staircase - it leads only to
Some old pictures of you
Through an a-thousand mile long tube
Hey, what's a city boy to do?

And you, like Concorde
I came, a gentle hill racer
I was breathless
Up on every mountain
Just to look for your light
But for less than a moment
We'd share the same sky
And then Isaac will suffer
Concorde will Fly

Concorde, we're old now
And you wield a lightsaber
And led by the dark to our place on the table
So don't tell me you're hungry
Cause darling I'm starving myself
And I heard you're on Atkins as well
I was made to love you
Can't you tell?

And you, like Concorde
I came, a light blue sleeper
And I laid dead or twitching
For most of the night
But I know that you'll be there
The Sandman inside
And I'll come to like a child
And Concorde and I
Die free this time

And though England is mine
I must leave it all behind
The war is over
Lift the anchors, set an open course
For New York state lines
I think of all that went wrong
The sailor boys light up in song
And they sing
Of London
Love they made there
Will it really last any time?
What's that that you said to me
Oh, I'm a chaos space marine
So what? I love you
Darling, will you take my metal hand? It's cold
In time you will find
These things take up space inside your mind
Where you could be keeping honest thoughts of the sea, alone

So I'm leaving this body
And I'm never coming home again
I'll bury the axe here
Between the window and the kingdom of men
Oh, I'm becoming a worm now
And I'm looking for a place to live, yeah
Here I come now

In time you will find
These things take up
In time you will find
These things take up
In time you will find
These things take you
And now - so long chumps!

I'm coming home
(Oh yeah)
Billie Eilish Style
A Concorde will fly
Ignore the hole I've dug again
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

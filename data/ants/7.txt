You're scared of a world where you're needed
So you never made nice with the locals
But you tied me up slow with your vine stuff
It takes a few years but they break bones
It takes a few months but our bones heal
We're stronger and we tell all our school friends
They sign our cast in the playground
Darling, the rest of my body, it's yours then

And I know
You're scared
Well, I am scared too
Oh but every time I try to make lunch
For anyone else in my head
I end up dreaming of you
And you come to me

Good morning
Show me the place where he inserted the blade
Or praise the Lord, burn my house
I get lost, I freak out
You come home and hold me tight
As if it never happened at all
Good morning
Show me the place where he inserted the blade
Good morning
Where is your light? Am I home?
I will hold to my chest where the wind can't exist
I will try not to keep you too long

So clean your soup maker and breathe in
Your chicken broccoli and everything
The tug that's between us that long string
Concorde, Bound 2 and my evening
The good hunter's guide to a bad night
Darling, I'll spoil it myself, thanks you're leaving
Well, I tried just to stroke your dreams better
But darling, I see that you're not really sleeping

But I know
You're tired
Well, I'm tired too
Oh but every time I try to make lunch
For anyone else in my head
I end up dreaming of you
And you come to me

Good morning
Show me the place where he inserted the blade
Or praise the Lord, burn my house
I get lost, I freak out
You come home and hold me tight
As if it never happened at all
Good morning
Show me the fifth or the cadence you want me to play
Good morning
Show me where to tie the other end of this chain

You walk up on the raised edge, hands out for balance
Slip and you almost grab mine but you find your feet
And I never wanted so much someone to fall
It's just been a weekend but in my mind
We summer in France with our genius daughters now
And you teach me to play the piano

You call
I'll be there
What's more
I'm scared of the phone
Don't ring it
Please know
That I'm just trying to find
Some way to keep me in your mind
And later on
Everyone will say "It was cool"

"She had Billie Eilish style"
"Moving to Berlin for a little while"
"Trying to find something to hold on to"
Never texts me nothing but she wants to
Tell me she's not that hard to find
And "Message me if you change your mind"
Darling, I'll keep fine

And if we're on a burning starship
The escape pods filled with your friends, your childhood film photos
There's no room for me to go
Oh, I'd wait there, float with the wreckage, fashion a long sword
Traverse the milky way trying to get home to you
And you bring some piece of the stars

You call
I'll be there
What's more
I'm scared of the phone
Don't ring it
Please know
That I'm just trying to find
Some way to keep me in your mind
And later on
Everyone will say "It was cool"

"She had Billie Eilish style"
"Moving to Berlin for a little while"
"Trying to find something to hold on to"
Never texts me nothing but she wants to
Tell me she's not that hard to find
And "Message me if you change your mind"
Darling, I'll keep fine

Ignore the hole I've dug again
It's only for the evening
I never wanted you to see that much
Of the bodies down there beneath me

You are the only one I've known
Who broke the world so quietly
And turned your perfect hands to me
And you ruptured every bone

We formed a ring around your home
To stop your body leaving
But you burnt the final question then
And you rose out through the ceiling

I turn my face and hide in shame
You take my tired body in
And you wrap it up in your undershirt
And you pray for the pain to leave him

We must let the clamp do what the clamp does best
I know you're coming home Henry
Just tell me when
We must let the clamp do what the clamp does best
That's a funny looking shrine on your bedroom wall
Well I'm sorry Henry
He doesn't look anything like Jesus at all
Your friend, the one that you loved
Did you keep him on your side?
Did you ever get to ask what on earth he meant by
"Might take some time to learn how to use these bodies right
But it is for this that God has gave us both the night"
And Henry hung to all of these
His battleship of memory
A small nation of souvenirs
Make Henry whole but porously

Oh, god of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah
Oh, god of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah
God of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah
God of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah
Oh, god of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah
Oh, god of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah

Oh, god of weather, Henry knows
Snow globes don't shake on their own, ah

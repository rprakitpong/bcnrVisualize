Concorde flies in my room
Tears the house to shreds
Defines the night as such:
A home for us, stick insects
And leaves no trace of luck
At every market town that we intersect
I die like fifteen times
A dark blue stem brings me to their breast

And I'm feeling kinda normal with a packed lunch
Train rides don't hurt much these days
We're all working on ourselves
And we're praying that the rest don't mind how much we've changed
So if you see me looking strange with a fresh style
I'm still not feeling that great
And then it's in soft focus all around you
You can't see the football game
On my dad's sofa we are still
And we never look at our phones anymore

Oh, I can't think of anything better
Pick a hair off my sweater
And drown in me
Like boyfriend jeans
Oh, I haven't felt this way in like ever
I am the convo, you are the weather
And the clamp is a cracked smile cheek
And it tortures me

I haven't felt this way in like ever
I am the convo, you are the weather
And the clamp is a cracked smile cheek
And it tortures me

In my bed sheets now wet
Of Charlie I pray to forget
All I've been forms the drone
We sing the rest
Ah, your generous loan to me
Your crippling interest

In my bed sheets now wet
Of Charlie I pray to forget
All I've been forms the drone
We sing the rest
Ah, your generous loan to me
Your crippling interest

In my bed sheets now wet
Of Charlie I pray to forget
All I've been forms the drone
We sing the rest
Ah, your generous loan to me
Your crippling interest

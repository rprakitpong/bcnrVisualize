Okay, well I just woke up
And you already don't care
That I tried my best to hold you
Through the headset that you wear
And, as tight as I might hold it
Over where the signal's good
There's no way to save your evening now
Through the little phone that could

And yes, I was tempted
And I christened me lonely
I pretended to falter
And I burnt scented candles there
And I hung some good pictures where
The paintwork was perfect
So no-one could doubt it
Oh, I was still losing

So show me the land you acquire
And slip into something beside
The holes you tried to hide
And lay out your rules for the night
Oh, don't eat your toast in my bed
Oh darling, I
I never felt the crumbs until you said
"This place is not for any man
Nor particles of bread"

You furnished your suffering
And you played a good organ
And the world gathered singing
Good words that you'd stolen
And every phone died then
And no-one had WiFi inside your apartment
So we knelt at your altar

Okay, well I just woke up
And you already don't care
That I tried my best to hold you
Through the headset that you wear
And, as tight as I might hold
Over where the signal's good
There's no way to save your evening now
And I'm ready for us to be understood

So show me the land you acquire
And slip into something beside
The holes you tried to hide
And lay out your rules for the night
Oh, don't eat your toast in my bed
Oh, darling I
I never felt the crumbs until you said
"This place is not for any man
Nor particles of bread"

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah
Watch the kite, it soars, then falls

Into the fight, the metal-clad knight
He roars then brawls
Then crawls into a hole where he toiled and recoiled
Over all that he had failed
That accolade that he'd betrayed
Now he decayed in the dark cave
Oh, so afraid
Where's the brigade?
Everything fades, what will remain, oh
Where's the way? Where is the way?
Hey, anyone there?

I'll take off my armour
If you promise to stay
Wipe your weeping eye
Lanterns light the lie
Of the life I'd thought I'd lived
In the place I thought I'd been
I defend and accuse
But it's me that brings down
The heavy hammer
The gavel begins to behave on its own
Then my arm turns to wood
Roots wrap round my wrist

Kite strings burn my palms

I am proud to know you
Can I make a cup of coffee?
Can I sit down next to you?
I might not speak for a while
But, just to be here with you, be with you
I might not be the best rider or fighter
But I think I'd like to be a little lighter
I could try to throw off the iron helmet
And indulge in memories
Make cavalries rest their heads
Make their beds out of the trees
Up on the trees
All that I lost is still with me
With the moss we will become the beacon
Which beckons me beyond the cave
I caved out
Take my shield
And blade off of me
Melt the silver down
I'll make you a crown

Then the wind stops, the clock ticks on
My stiffened heart grows tighter
I searched from the moon
And down towards the fish
And the tide and the moon
Had their own alliance
I stood with my ghost
We tried to hold the kite
My wooden hand, my wooden heart
Now all the fights are fought and moments gone
But still, they must be here, they must, but

Are you there?
Can you see me?
Are you listening?
Won't you stay now?
The rain's coming down
The wind's blowing high
Thunder closer
Lightning striking

We hurtle through the sky
Shredded kite in the trees
The sun's gone home now
But our hands reach
Clammed together

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah, ah

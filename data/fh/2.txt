I thought it once
I thought it well
And maybe even
Time could tell
That all I know and all I've known
Could fit into a
Little tiny box
And all the world would laugh and lose their socks

How many things can one read till they feel they're not afraid of it all?
How many cases of words?
Am I being absurd?
Doing fine
I'm having a whale of a time
But if the world could consume all the things that you knew
We'd be living the life
A contender for a wife
We'd be having a laugh
Wish I could make them laugh, mm-mmm
In joke there comes the truth
I am not blinded by my youth
The five years had their time
But you sit in a lane much like mine

For when all is said and done
What's left is
Far beyond the problems that are listed
It may be easy
Just believe me
That our life holds a light no life has held before

Maybe I speak in a way
That makes it seem like I was born yesterday
But I'm not afraid of it all
There'll be another who's seen every colour but it's all in the shade
Look at the life that we've made

No word or phrase
Has the power to say what the tie is we share
It's far greater than rare, oh yeah
In dark there comes the light
And we must try with all our might
To keep this thing alive
We've got that house by the bay
There's no place that I'd rather stay
I'll stay there right till the day where you shall
Pass
I too shall pass
All things must pass
Like days
They pass from one to another and another
I will love no other, no
No
I know now, I know now that, yeah, that
Life is good and I feel understood
Do you?
If you don't, let me know
And now here comes the chorus

For when all is said and done
What's left is
Far beyond the problems that are listed
It may be easy
Just, baby, believe me that our life

If time was on my side, I would ask him to return
To a moment which holds for us
A great concern
Which moment to pick?
Which time to select?
There are so many chances steeped in regret
No matter which one you choose, baby, you're always gonna lose
Well, that's what the demons say
I never liked those guys anyway

Ring at six, the day begins, she stumbles down the stairway
Porridge on, "I won't be long"
To Dad sat in his chair
Shoves it down, let's take the town and make this week a wonder
Better than the one before but she knows it won't be so

Her train approaches
Will they notice
Should she miss this one and start the week alone

On the way to class and so it starts, she'll play the jester
Pushed around, ignored, let down
Their laughs are at, not with

So she bites back but she falls flat
They say they're only teasing
Made the fool, that's life at school
What a way to treat your friend

She screams in the shower
Lost all of her power
Keep face, she'll leave no trace, not even in her home

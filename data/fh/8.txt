There's a time and a place and the place, it is now
Take the smile off your face while you're dressed like a cow
And you're frolicking 'round, your legs are in the air
There's a smile on your face but it's covered in hair
Do you want it?
Do you want it?

You run through the streets like the whore that you are
And you hope pretty soon you'll be struck by the car
But the light of the day tries to keep you afloat
While there's pain in your stomach and there's pain in your throat
Do you want it?
Do you want it?

Mother, would you take me?
Anon, anon
For I have nothing, no more baby, nah nah
She's gone, anon

I tried to take the word and what you said
I tried to take the word but the word was dead
I did not want it
And in the light of day it all seemed well
Oh, was it just a dream, she could not tell
But how she wanted

There's a time and a place and the place it is now
Take that smile off your face while you're dressed like a cow
When you're frolicking 'round, legs in the air
There's a smile on your face but it's covered in hair
Do you want it?
Oh no, but do you want it now?

Oh, just imagine a life with a baby and wife
What the times would look like, when compared to the knife
But the money's not there so you sit in despair
Curse at the sky with the cry, "It's not fair"
Do you want it?
No, no, please tell me, do you want it?

'Cause the rapture of the autumn eve lead to a fate no-one believed
Taking to the table where she wrote, she held herself a vote
A vote between the good and bad, with all she'd seen and all she'd had
Nancy tried to take the night, but now she's gone removed from sight and now, yeah

Mother, would you take me?
Anon, anon
For I have nothing, no more, baby
No, no, she's gone, anon
If I could take it back now, would I take it back now?
If he could take it back now
Would he take it back now?
Nancy took the night and she's gone anon

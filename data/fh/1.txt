We chopped off your arms
Chopped off your beautiful purple hair
But we had to make room for the living, the living room
But

But I think that
The lemons might make
A comeback this year
Maybe we'll get the beets to join us
This time around the Sun
You fetch the apples, I'll bake the pie
Maybe we'll all fall out

Put on my boots, hop, skip or step on the thread
The thread linking our bodies with each other
Tangled like the roots of the ghost trunk
A new one could grow?

But I think that
The lemons might make a comeback this year
Maybe we'll get the beets to join us
This time around the Sun
You fetch the apples, I'll bake the pie
Maybe we'll all fall out

Put on my boots, hop, skip or step on the thread
The purple thread linking my head to the root
We won't worry it will grow

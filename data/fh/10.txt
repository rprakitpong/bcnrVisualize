I tap as I talk
I text while I walk
To you
I tell you I'm here
And I wait by the door, up the stairs, then I'm there
How was your day?
Are you in pain
Still?
I sit on the side of the couch in the cold
In the empty apartment you recently sold
Is that why I'm here?

I've fallen in love with a feeling
I fell down a hole at a speed at which I do not know
Ah
Ah

Went back to the ladies
That kissed me for ages and left
I don't believe him
Leaning on me when I feel so incapable

I've fallen in love with a seedling
A towering flower that's grown so incredibly high
Ah
Ah
Ah

I've fallen in love with a fear I believe in
I sink in my nails till I feel it inside
I've fallen in love with a feeling
I've fallen in love with a feeling, don't tell me good bye
Ah
Ah
To truly believe in
In love with a feeling
I've fallen in love

Ah
Ah

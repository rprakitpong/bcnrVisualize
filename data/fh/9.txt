Uncurtain the day
My head pops out
It's another cold grey morning
Over-stew the water, it mostly turns to air

Out for a walk
I imagine three times
Slipping on the wet leaves
And the blood rushing out from the cracks in my head
Then merges with the red and amber mulch

The hesitating silence
Between the man and the dog
Overdone routine, the man reaches down to pick up the shit
I make eye contact with the dog
We both look away

I am back home now
I move my fingers on the piano keys
And I am back to thinking whether she's sobbing in the men's room again

I shall boil some beans
I should get my vitamin B
The last video I watched told me the pH of my gut microbiome was certainly causing my blues
So I fill myself up with fibre
As dusk begins to set

The old man across the street
The clinical glow from your window
Why don't you get a warm lamp?
It looks like a tiny UFO is trying to land in there

His head begins to droop
And I make eye contact with his balding patch
Turn off the TV, old man

I light the candle
It's time to curtain the night
It is only 5 o'clock

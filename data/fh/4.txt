I'm a faraway traveller
I travel alone
Searching in the mist
For what I know, exists for me out there

Solitary, awaits me out there
I know she always will
She was there before rain
Before these dunes, before they made the pyramids

Oh, waited so long
Have I finally found the road to lead on?
The moon was low and the road dusty
When I was captured by some thieves
My pockets empty
I said, you'll have to kill me
To cut this jewel out of me
They let me go

Stopped at the next bar, for a neat drink
Across from where I sat a man gazed at me
He looked just like James Dean
On the silver screen
Our eyes did meet
And he winked at me
Is this the one?

Have I finally found a man to lean on?
Will you help me and my horses on my way
Through night and day?

Oh, I can see my destination on the line
And if the stars are aligned
Not gonna be a next time
I'll check him as he's sleeping
Can never trust a man who's drinking whisky at the bar alone
But his arms are around your waist
And your hair is blowing in the wind and it feels alright

And on that second night he came for me
He took his knife out his boot and silently, I learned the truth
He was liar
A leach and beggar
And through the embers
I watched him kill my horses

River, river take me
Down to the waterfall
Won't come back at all
Just let me fall
Ah
Ah

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

I wanna be anywhere other than this
I wanna see my best friend waving at me
I wanna be living with you
Seeing it through
Do you wanna play?
Forever how long can I play?
A song I made, yeah, it's a song
I'm gonna read something that's good
But I'll listen to you

I'm not asking much
Just enough
Fill my cup
Get me up
You make me laugh, babe

Yeah, I know what's expected of me
Besties, night and day
Remember when I said he shouldn't treat you that way, and are you sure?
I know I want something more

And what about you?
In fact, don't answer that
Wouldn't want it any other way
'Cause this feels
Bestie girl
Take it back now
What you feel is the hole in your life
And she's probably right
She's probably right
Right, right...

(Just enough) I project
(Fill my cup) I get wet
(Get me up) I get dry
(You make me laugh, babe)
You make cry, babe
Yeah, I came out and where were you?
I think you see right through me
Bestie, on my mind
Just lean into it
I'm a walking TikTok trend
But the colour runs out in the end

Ah-ah-ah-ooh
(Ah-ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ooh)
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

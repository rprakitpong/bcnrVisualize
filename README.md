Visualizing BCNR's stylistic change

## Disclaimer
I like the new stuff. I'm not a girl-hater-Isaac-glazer. Chill out. 

## Why
As I was listening to the new album, I felt many changes compared to the previous albums. One of the changes I felt was the denser writing. While I'm not very musically-inclined, luckily I'm decent at vibe coding. I wanted to know exactly how this element of their writing style changed.

## How
After copying down the lyrics and tracklisting, I processed them into plots. Note that my focus was on the feeling of denseness, so when counting words, I discarded elements that I thought did not contribute to those feelings, as in:
- Vocalizations like "oh" and "ah"
- Repeat lines in a song, since I don't have to think again about what the line means

## Notable result
### Words per second per album

This more-or-less lined up with my feeling that Forever Howlong was lyrically denser than their previous albums. 
### Words per second per lyricist

I'm a bit surprised here. I thought May would score the highest, given her lean into story-telling.  

Note that for the first two albums, I used the term "Isaac-era" for lyricist, even though all the members are credited lyricists on those songs. This is for clarity of the time origin of the songs.
